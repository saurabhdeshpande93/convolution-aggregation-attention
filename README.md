## Convolution, aggregation and attention based deep neural networks  

We propose different types of deep learning surrogate models for non-linear FEM simulations. This repository provides the implementations of "Convolution, aggregation and attention based deep neural networks for accelerating simulations in mechanics". While the datasets used in the paper are available on [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7585319 ](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7585319).
